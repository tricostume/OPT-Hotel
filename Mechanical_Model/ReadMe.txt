The foldel called 'Mechanical_model_simulation_the_whole_year' deals with the generation of the Hotel using lumped parameters (two points for each wall and 1 for the air inside of each room). It requires not so much RAM but it requires a lot of time to compute the whole year. I suggest to check just a short period
 
The folder called 'Generator_of_the_mechanical_equations' generates the relations between rooms considering walls as a resistance and the air of each room lumped in a point.
