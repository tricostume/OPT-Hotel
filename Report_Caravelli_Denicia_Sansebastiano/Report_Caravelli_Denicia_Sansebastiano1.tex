\section{Abstract}
Energy management is one of the most important aspects treated in Engineering and sciences. Either a path planning problem or an energy harvesting field of wind turbines, the necessity to ensure optimality is always present when competitivity is desired. Optimisation at the service of Engineering is a broad field of development and deals with a very dynamic set of applications that can be present even in the normal life.

While technology is improving with time, new intelligence layers are being added to existing systems in order to make them reactive to predefined constraints \cite{intelligent_decisions}. Optimisation problems that were before only tangible for those having to do directly with the development of a product are becoming every day more popular and widely used by normal users.

Hotels and other accommodation providers deal with the problem of assigning booking requests in an optimum way. The majority of homologous systems attempt to forecast the energy consumption of the analysed buildings or to monitor it and propose alternative solutions to decrease it \cite{university}. Others already go a step further in proposing systems that optimise tenants' comfort or energy consumption reduction by means of complex techniques like reinforcement learning \cite{reinf_learn} while at the same time adapting them to the usage pattern of the user.

While approaching in the same manner the multi objective problem of assigning the rooms to the guests in the most profitable way, this work deals also with the construction of an agent with an extra intelligence layer capable of choosing assignment sequences that ensure optimality in the sense of energy consumption. This framework can be envisioned as part of a smart building environment and chapter \ref{intro} introduces formally the problem formulation that motivates its creation. Chapter \ref{state_art} analyses further the actual situation of the development field and gives an insight on the profitability of such a system in the actual environment. Chapters \ref{development} and \ref{campaign} describe more deeply the development and validation strategies adopted and finally, chapter \ref{results} concludes on the topic and provides an outlook with possible future improvements.

\section{Introduction and proposal} \label{intro}
Even though energy consumption is penalised by governmental bodies with norms like DPR 412/1993 \cite{normDPR}, it is also in the interests of hotel managers to ensure a lower energy consumption as it generates a more profitable situation for them. One could naively think that such a system would only be profitable for winter season, while in reality, in summer the problem happens in the same form as temperature regulation is needed. As an initial proposal, it is interesting to look for solutions that ensure profit maximisation as a first priority and then looks in the feasible set of assignments for those being energetically optimal.

In this context, the next assumptions were taken
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Assume the existence of differed heat sources in every room of the building. This widens the research field and helps understand better the optimisation problem due to the variety in degrees of freedom.
	\item Common areas like corridors or lounges should be heated up whenever new clients arrive. 
	\item Without losing generality, assignment of a room implies its direct heating given that its coupling relations with other rooms are to be considered.
	\item A model predictive approach is to be used in order to broaden the degree of action of controls on the building to be considered.
\end{enumerate}

An example that motivates this direction of research can be seen in Fig.~\ref{figTemper_onoff}. A lumped-parameter model of a hotel consisting of three floors and more than 80 rooms was designed and tested. A regular ON-OFF control strategy was adopted for its simulation, given that it is the common approach adopted for temperature management in the real life. As seen, while the first and third floor  are heated up, the second floor finds itself already at the optimal temperature value, for which assigning a new booking request to any of the rooms in the middle would be a more intelligent solution from an incipient energy optimising approach.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth, height=0.22\textwidth]{img/temperature_anal.png}
	\caption{\textit{Temperature of three rooms located one over the other having various customers along 6 days.}}
	\label{figTemper_onoff}
\end{figure}

Finally, it is important to say that the energetically optimal solutions are not necessarily predictable, and are expected to be dependent on several preconditions, among which the isolating performance of the hotel can be of interest. One attempts, however to exploit the adjacency relations of the rooms, the existence of natural heating sources like the sun radiation and a good estimation of the outer temperature to enrich a model in order to be able to forecast the energy consumption and to pick the best solution.

\section{Results and conclusion} \label{results}
%\subsection{Results}
Table \ref{Table_RPD} confirms the fact that for this optimisation run, energy is saved. 

\begin{table}[htbp]
	\centering
	\caption{Relative percentage difference}
	\label{Table_RPD}
	\begin{tabular}{lllll}
		Occupancy     & 30\%  & 50\% & 65\%  \\
		Hotel 1-floor & 5.68  & 8.88 & 4.27  \\
		Hotel 3-floor & 11.27 & 8.73 & 4.27  \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

In general, the obtained results prove that an increasing revenue is ensured for lower occupancy rates. However, the small hotel (30\% occupancy rate) seems not to follow this expected behaviour. By analysing particular results, it was possible to propose possible causes to this event:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item In many of the cases, more than one overlapping high quality rooms were proposed. The small hotel counts only with one high quality room and therefore the degree of compatibility in different assignments potentially decreases. Maximum revenue can therefore only be obtained by reassigning low and medium level rooms.
	\item It was possible to notice that the solar radiation had an important effect on the dynamics of the system. Rooms facing the south side of the building are favoured with more solar radiation. For some cases, the energy consumption optimised assignment selected rooms near this location first, however the higher level rooms were located in unfavoured locations with respect to solar irradiation. This again constrained the capacity of assignation for which both energetic and revenue optimisation approaches were very similar in nature.
\end{enumerate}

The sensor bar is made of eight binary Reed sensors, which detects magnetic field. The detectors are spaced by 1 cm. The strip of sensors is located so that it is perpendicular to the x-axis of the robot, at a known position along $\textrm{X}_m$.
%The magnets are the beacons of the localization system. They are arranged as a squared array with a spacing of 55 mm.
%
%The robot also has two encoders, with a resolution of 360 dots per revolution.
%
%The localization system uses an EKF (Extended Kalman Filter).
