\section{Abstract}
The energy consumption is probably the most important aspects engineers have to take into account when they project a robot case or plan the action sequence to make it do. Generally, this problem is handle by optimal path research and optimal decision analysis. There are infinitive application in robotics regarding optimal storage strategy, for instance, manipulators managing storehouse have to decide where they have to store the packs according to shortest time spend, force and velocity they can apply on the pack (fragile or not), and best storage location according to the specifics of the object: the robot do have to put milk in a fridge, not in a hoover. Our analysis deals with this last case: where I do have to put something which must stay in specific temperature bounds. In particular, we analysed how the customers are placed in hotel room according to their needs, at first, the maximal revenue the hotel owner can get and the minimal energy usage to keep the temperature feasible to live by law. In this paper we are going to analyse the Winter period, but the identical approach can be used to find the optimal distribution during Summer.

\section{Introduction and proposal}
This paper deals with the necessity of reducing the energy loss in hotels related to the usage of heat sources (radiators, heat pumps, etc..).
Since a hotel has to provide a fixed minimum in every room used to host of 20 $\pm$ 2 \textcelsius \ by the norm DPR nÂ° 412/1993, during Winter, at least in Europe, hotel managers need to turn on heaters. Assuming the buildings we are observing have the possibility to turn on and off the heat sources of each room independently from the other ones we wonder if the usage of the heat source is just dependent on the dimension of the specific room or if the other rooms will contributes to reduce the energy required to heat up the considered room. Moreover, we assume that if none booked a room on a day, that heater is not active in that room on that specific day. In order to see check it we made a lumped parameter model of the hotel using a on/off controller, having heat pumps as heating (and cooling) system source. These heat pumps directly blow wormed air in the room (forced convection), so they are very fast, and easy to control by an on/off control. The figure \ref{figTemper_onoff} shows that, thanks to the fact the room located on the first floor (blue line) is occupied on the days 2, 4, 5 and the room located on the third floor (blue line) is occupied on the days 2, 4, 6, the room located on the second floor (red line), which is in the middle, receives a consistent heat flux from the other two. That room is never booked on the mentioned period, but its temperature is almost always above to minimum temperature required to keep the heat pump off (18.5 \textcelsius).
Finally, we have the proof the temperature of a room influences the one of the other and vice verse. Thus, we want to formulate and optimal decision algorithm, which takes in consideration all the rooms in their complexity, to accept, at first, the best requests combination among the ones we have, and then, optimize the distribution of the accepted costumers in the rooms available.

%The robot used to collect the data is a Lego NXT robot equipped with a sensor developed at ECN. This robot is classified as a unicycle robot (2,0). The sensor bar is made of eight binary Reed sensors, which detects magnetic field. The detectors are spaced by 1 cm. The strip of sensors is located so that it is perpendicular to the x-axis of the robot, at a known position along $\textrm{X}_m$.
%The magnets are the beacons of the localization system. They are arranged as a squared array with a spacing of 55 mm.
%
%The robot also has two encoders, with a resolution of 360 dots per revolution.
%
%The localization system uses an EKF (Extended Kalman Filter).
