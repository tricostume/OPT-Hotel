%\subsection{Analysis of the market}
In order to understand the algorithms already used we decided to perform a market analysis asking to specific hotels, located in Genoa, chosen according to they class of quality (number of stars) to explore every kind of quality service provided: the quality service is a valid index to check the possible price of a room, and so the possible revenue coming from each room. In particular we asked if they make forecasts on the demand according to their own customers and/or the Genoa statistics, and if they use software to manage the demand. Surprisingly, we found out the just the 20\% of the hotel manager interviewed use to check the demand statistics and they take more into consideration the agencies' forecasts more than looking at their past customers. \\
On the other hand the usage of computer to manage the whole hotel is a common layer. It bursts all the paper work and the customer distribution could not wait for a different fate. However, none  uses a software which optimizes the room booking, most of the software just uses a first list/first choice or a random choice. The internet sources reveal some software which are sponsored as optimization software, but they do not have the algorithm available because of industry secret. The hotel manager must pass to the software the parameters of the rooms like price and grade of priority. These kind of software, instead, tend to optimize the revenue management (schedule an offer campaign and the optimal room price) more than optimize the room booking.\\
Thanks to researches we are confident that the algorithm (based of the energy consumption) we want to propose is not already present on the market. Since it is strictly related to topology of the hotel (room adjacencies), we strongly think companies doing building energy analysis could be interested in offering this kind of service to their clients.

Anyway, the algorithm we are proposing for this specific problem is largely versatile to solve every placing and/or storage optimization.
