Notes: With decreasing sampling frequency, non heated rooms become more pessimistic.This error is the error of
sampling. We recommend to include in the formulation problem different simulation and optimisation frequencies.
In specific, one could include subsimulation constraints so that the simulation runs at Ts points but
only n_o*Ts point is interesting for optimisation quantities. Notice that in this case:
n_o = number of simulating units -> quantity taken for optimisation purposes
Ts -> simulating units (always smaller or equal than the optimisation units)
