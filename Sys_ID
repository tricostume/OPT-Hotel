This section deals with the parameter identification of the system. The sequence followed to reach the results presented are:
1. Initial guess: Modelling with theoretical parameters based on tables.
2. Improvement: Generation of initial guess with LIP model.
3. Proposition of a small number of parameters characterising the space.
4. Non Linear Mathematical Programming implemented (LSQNONLIN, constrained, default)
5. Relaxation of parameters to improve results.
